## File locations

Everything under the run's own dir `<rundir>` = `.tmp/review-gauntlet/<run-id>/` (create at the start
of a fresh run; on resume, reuse the run's existing dir). Per-run dirs are what keep concurrent runs'
files from colliding — see "Run identity and concurrency".

| File (under `<rundir>`) | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `findings-raw-<shard>.md` | Codex's raw adversarial findings, one file per sweep shard (single-shard runs have one) |
| `verdicts-<chunk>.md` | Neutral verification verdicts per chunk (which findings survive) |
| `state.md` | Live per-finding ledger — a **cache/hint**, not the source of truth (see below) |
| `prs.json` | Batched `gh pr list` snapshot of this run's PRs — the per-wake reconcile input (Loop control) |
| `lease.json` | This run's active-driver lease (`{agent, updated}`; see "Run lease") |
| `review-<pr>-<n>.txt` | Codex's PR review output, round `n` |
| `review-<pr>-<n>.plan.jsonl` | Orchestrator-authored review work units for round `n` |
| `review-<pr>-<n>.progress.jsonl` | Reviewer progress events against the plan for round `n` |
| `ci-<pr>.txt` | Latest `gh pr checks` snapshot for a PR (re-polled after the watch, not the watch stream) |
| `abort-<id>.md` | Detailed log for an aborted finding-task |

Store ALL codex and `gh` output to `.tmp/` first, then Read/Grep it. NEVER `/tmp/`.

**Durable cross-run knowledge lives outside `.tmp/`.** `.tmp/` may be wiped between runs, so the
one thing a *new* run needs to remember from old ones — the carryover ledger — is kept at the repo
root under `.review-gauntlet/history/` (git-ignored; add `.review-gauntlet/` to `.gitignore` if
missing), **one file per run** (`<run-id>.md`) so concurrent runs never clobber a shared file. It
survives `.tmp` cleanup. Everything else stays ephemeral under the per-run `<rundir>`. See
"Fresh runs and carryover".

### The ledger — `state.md`

One row per surviving finding. It is a **cache**, not the authoritative state — **ground truth is
git + GitHub** (`gh pr list/view` for PRs and merged/open state, `git rev-parse HEAD` per branch for
the live SHA, `gh pr checks` for live CI, and the `review-<pr>-<n>.txt` files for which verdicts
exist on which SHA). Every wake re-derives what's due from those, then refreshes this file. So a
stale or half-written ledger is self-healing — never act on it without reconciling against git/gh
first.

The file opens with a short run-config header (`run_id`, `base_branch`, `api_changes`, `phase` —
re-read every wake, see Constraints and "Run identity and concurrency"), then one row per finding:

```
run_id: g260704-0915-a3f29c1b  # this run's identity — namespaces its dir/branches/label/wakes (set once)
base_branch: main       # the branch PRs target & diffs measure against (set once; see "Base branch")
api_changes: ask        # ask | allowed (run-wide; set once from the invocation)
phase: fanout           # reviewing (Stage 0) → fanout (Stage 1+); written at run start before Stage 0

id | slug | branch | worktree | pr | head_sha | reviews_ok | ci | attempts | started | status
```

- `head_sha` — the branch tip (`git rev-parse HEAD`) that `reviews_ok` and `ci` describe. `ci` is
  pinned to this exact SHA. `reviews_ok` is pinned to this SHA **unless** the only change is a clean
  base-only rebase/merge with the PR diff unchanged; then carry `reviews_ok` forward to the new
  `head_sha` and set `ci = pending`.
- `reviews_ok` — number of fresh, context-isolated SATISFIED verdicts recorded against this PR's
  current content (need 2).
- `ci` — `green` / `red` / `pending` / `none` for `head_sha`.
- `attempts` — task attempts so far (for the retry-once bailout).
- `started` — wall-clock start of the current attempt (for the 1-hour cap).
- `status` — `pending` → `in_review` → `mergeable` → `merged`, or `aborted`; plus `awaiting-api`
  while parked for the user to approve an API-changing fix.
